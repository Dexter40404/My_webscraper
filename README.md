# My_webscraper, feel free to use as you wish its bad anyway lol
This webscraper is used for finding words in urls then write the output into the .txt file, count the total words (useful for me idk if for anyone else tbh) and
print them into the console

The scraper sometimes prints out a weird things in the output file, that i dont really understand, I have a theory that it is .css

EDIT:
the code now prints total numbers inside the total.txt file
